Vaulty is an HTTP reverse and forward proxy that performs the modification (encrypt, mask, tokenize) of the request and response bodies on the fly and securely stores it in a safe. Vaulty can be used for the following:

- Anonymize data before it reaches your APIs and backends
- Get encryption / decryption for your APIs without changing a line of code
- Provide filtered data for specific group of users like support stuff, etc.
- Tokenize credit cards, SSNs, etc. for companies that are PCI compliant
- Encrypt your customers data when you import this data from 3d party services (access tokens, PII, etc.)

## Routes

Routes are the heart of the Vaulty. Routes describe when and how Vaulty should perform transformations. Currently, Vaulty identifies routes based on the HTTP requestsâ€™ properties, such as path and method. When you run Vaulty it needs to load information about routes. Let's look at the routes file with the transformations:

```json
{
	"vault": {
		"upstream": "https://api.yourbackend.com"
	},
	"routes": {
		"inbound": [
			{
				"method": "POST",
				"path": "/cards",
				"request_transformations": [
					{
						"type": "json",
						"expression": "card.number",
						"action": { "type": "tokenize" }
					},
					{
						"type": "json",
						"expression": "card.cvc",
						"action": { "type": "tokenize" }
					}
				]
			}
		],
		"outbound": [
			{
				"method": "POST",
				"path": "https://api.stripe.com/v1/tokens",
				"request_transformations": [
					{
						"type": "json",
						"expression": "card.number",
						"action": { "type": "detokenize" }
					},
					{
						"type": "json",
						"expression": "card.cvc",
						"action": { "type": "detokenize" }
					}
				]
			}
		]
	}
}
```

Routes file describes transformations of inbound (reverse proxy) and outbound (forward proxy) requests and responses.

In this file, we specify the default upstream for inbound routes: all inbound requests are forwarded to vault's upstream: https://api.yourbackend.com.

In routes section we describe one inbound route for POST requests with /cards path. Body of such requests will be transformed as following:

- element of json request body **card.number** will be tokenized
- element of json request body **card.cvc** will be tokenized

Outbound route in this file describes the opposite. In requests that goe to [https://api.stripe.com/v1/tokens](https://api.stripe.com/v1/tokens) Vaulty replaces elements of json request body such as **card.number** and **card.cvc** with their original values and pass the resulting json to the destination.
